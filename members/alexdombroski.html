                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a computer science major focusing a good portion of my studies on web development. It's my forth semester at BYUI, with just a few left.</p>
                <p>I grew up in Middleton, Idaho.</p>
                <p>I served a fulltime mission for the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day saints in Hawaii. I enjoyed meeting people and learning about all the cultures there.</p>

        <section id="interests">
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I love board games, card games, video games, or anything that involves strategy. My favorite card game is <a href="https://alexanderdombroski.github.io/wdd130/sr101/index.html">star realms</a>, and my favorite board game is rummikub.</p>
            <p>I love creating things, whether it be software applications, building legos, making good food, I find satisaction with contributing to a finished product. Of course... more than I love cooking food, I love eating food. My favorite food I got to try in Hawaii was Loco Moco, and I enjoy making food from my mission.</p>
            <p>I play a fair amount of piano and ukulele. I also did choir for a few years and enjoy singing.</p>

                <h2>Web Experience</h2>
                <p>I started learning web development in High School. I took a bootcamp and made a multi-page website for a fictitious restraunt that sells fries. Being from Idaho, I love all forms of potatoes, especially fries.</p>
                <p>In college I have expanded much more on what I've learned. I've learned JavaScript and good site-building practices. It has interested me so much that I've chosen to build several personal projects.</p>
                <p>I learning how to use React, TypeScript, and Node.js. I've made several projects where I've worked with APIs and also one with a firebase database.</p>
