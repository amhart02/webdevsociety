            <h1>I'm Alayna Hart! I am from Iowa and this is my 6th semester at BYU-I. I am a web design and development major minoring in computer programming. I love to play sports and video games, listen to music, and watch movies. My favorite part of being a WDD major is building beautiful and functional websites (unlike this website haha).</h1>
